# Customer Report

**Purpose:**
 This report consolidates key customer metrics and behaviors

**Highlights:**

1. Gathers essential fields such as names, ages, and transaction details.

2. Segments customers into categories (VIP, Regular, New) and age groups.

3. Aggregates customer-level metrics:

	- total orders

	- total sales

	- total quantity purchased

	- total products

	- lifespan (in months)

4. Calculates valuable KPIs:

	- recency (months since last order)

	- average order value

	- average monthly spend
