# Magnitude Analysis

Compare the measure values by categories. It helps to understand the importance of different categories.

Formula: Aggregate [Measures] By [Dimensions]

**Purpose:**
    
- To quantify data and group results by specific dimensions.

- For understanding data distribution across categories.

**SQL Functions Used:**

- Aggregate Functions: SUM(), COUNT(), AVG()

- GROUP BY, ORDER BY

Find total customers by countries
```sql
SELECT
    country,
    COUNT(customer_key) AS total_customers
FROM gold.dim_customers
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY total_customers DESC;
```
Find total customers by gender
```sql
SELECT
    gender,
    COUNT(customer_key) AS total_customers
FROM gold.dim_customers
GROUP BY gender
ORDER BY total_customers DESC;
```
Find total products by category
```sql
SELECT
    category,
    COUNT(product_key) AS total_products
FROM gold.dim_products
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY total_products DESC;
```
What is the average costs in each category?
```sql
SELECT
    category,
    ROUND(AVG(product_cost),2) AS avg_cost
FROM gold.dim_products
GROUP BY category
ORDER BY avg_cost DESC;
```
What is the total revenue generated for each category?
```sql
SELECT
    p.category,
    SUM(f.sales_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM gold.fact_sales f
LEFT JOIN gold.dim_products p
    ON p.product_key = f.product_key
GROUP BY p.category
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```
What is the total revenue generated by each customer?
```sql
SELECT
    c.customer_key,
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name,
    SUM(f.sales_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM gold.fact_sales f
LEFT JOIN gold.dim_customers c
    ON c.customer_key = f.customer_key
GROUP BY 
    c.customer_key,
    c.first_name,
    c.last_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```
What is the distribution of sold items across countries?
```sql
SELECT
    c.country,
    SUM(f.quantity) AS total_sold_items
FROM gold.fact_sales f
LEFT JOIN gold.dim_customers c
    ON c.customer_key = f.customer_key
GROUP BY c.country
ORDER BY total_sold_items DESC;
```
