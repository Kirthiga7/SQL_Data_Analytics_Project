# Performance Analysis 

Comparing the current value to a target value. Helps to measure success and compare performance.

Current[Measure] - Target[Measure]

**Purpose:**

- To measure the performance of products, customers, or regions over time.

- For benchmarking and identifying high-performing entities.

- To track yearly trends and growth.

**SQL Functions Used:**
    
- LAG(): Accesses data from previous rows.

- AVG() OVER(): Computes average values within partitions.

- CASE: Defines conditional logic for trend analysis.

Analyze the yearly performance of products by comparing their sales 
to both the average sales performance of the product and the previous year's sales 
```sql
WITH yearly_product_sales AS (
    SELECT
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM f.order_date) AS order_year,
        p.product_name,
        SUM(f.sales_amount) AS current_sales
    FROM gold.fact_sales f
    LEFT JOIN gold.dim_products p
        ON f.product_key = p.product_key
    WHERE f.order_date IS NOT NULL
    GROUP BY 
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM f.order_date),
        p.product_name
