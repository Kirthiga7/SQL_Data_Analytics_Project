Determine the first and last order date and the total duration in months and years
```sql
SELECT 
    MIN(order_date) AS first_order_date,
    MAX(order_date) AS last_order_date,
    EXTRACT(year FROM AGE(MAX(order_date), MIN(order_date))) AS order_range_year,
	 (EXTRACT(YEAR FROM AGE(MAX(order_date), MIN(order_date))) * 12) + 
      EXTRACT(MONTH FROM AGE(MAX(order_date), MIN(order_date))) AS order_range_months
FROM  gold.fact_sales;
```
Find the youngest and oldest customer based on birthdate
```sql
SELECT
    MIN(birth_date) AS oldest_birthdate,
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM AGE(MIN(birth_date))) AS oldest_age,
    MAX(birth_date) AS youngest_birthdate,
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM AGE(MAX(birth_date))) AS youngest_age
FROM 
    gold.dim_customers;
```
