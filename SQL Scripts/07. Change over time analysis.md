**SQL Functions Used:**

- Date Functions: DATE_TRUNC(), TO_CHAR()

- Aggregate Functions: SUM(), COUNT(), AVG()

Analyse sales performance over time. Quick Date Functions
```SQL
SELECT
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) AS order_year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) AS order_month,
    SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_key) AS total_customers,
    SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM gold.fact_sales
WHERE order_date IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY order_year, order_month
ORDER BY order_year, order_month;
```
-- DATE_TRUNC() - Rounds a date or timestamp to a specified date part
```SQL
--Group order in the same month together
SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) AS order_date, 
    SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_key) AS total_customers,
    SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM gold.fact_sales
WHERE order_date IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date)
ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date);

--Group order in the same year together
SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('year', order_date) AS order_date, 
    SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_key) AS total_customers,
    SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM gold.fact_sales
WHERE order_date IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('year', order_date)
ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('year', order_date);
```
-- TO_CHAR() for specific Format
```SQL
SELECT
    TO_CHAR(order_date, 'YYYY-Mon') AS order_date,
    SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_key) AS total_customers,
    SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM gold.fact_sales
WHERE order_date IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY TO_CHAR(order_date, 'YYYY-Mon')
ORDER BY MIN(order_date);
```
